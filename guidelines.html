<p>Here is an excerpt from Engineers Canada about national guidelines pertaining to climate adaptation for engineers available here: https://engineerscanada.ca/public-policy/climate-change-and-engineering</p>
<p>The Canadian Engineering Qualifications Board has published a <a href="https://engineerscanada.ca/public-guideline-principles-of-climate-adaptation-and-mitigation-for-engineers">national guideline</a> for engineers on the principles of climate adaptation and mitigation for engineers. It is intended to set out general concepts and principles to inform engineering professionals on why adaptation and mitigation of climate change is relevant in professional practice. The guideline helps inform engineers of the 11 guiding principles, how to address the implications of climate change in their professional practice, and most importantly, how to create a clear record of the outcomes of those considerations. </p>
<p>The Canadian Engineering Qualifications Board has also published a <a href="https://engineerscanada.ca/national-guideline-on-sustainable-development-and-environmental-stewardship-for-professional-engineers">national guideline</a>  on sustainable development and environmental stewardship for engineers. The guideline describes engineering practices that are anticipatory of sustainable development and preventative in degrading the environment. Each of the 10 guidelines that the document lays out are intended for engineers to practice in an environmentally responsible and sustainable manner. In particular, they are intended to be pro-active in the protection and stewardship of the environment by following principles of sustainability. Since 2018, Engineers Canada has partnered with Polytechnique Montr√©al to offer a free massive open online course (MOOC) entitled Sustainability in Practice, which demonstrates the practical application of the 10 guidelines in engineering practice. Sustainability in Practice is offered twice each year. </p>
