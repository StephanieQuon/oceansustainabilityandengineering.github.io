							<p>Here is a great overview from SNC Lavalin (full article: https://careers.snclavalin.com/blogs/2022-4/how-do-electrical-engineers-in-canada-address-climate-change).</p>
							
							<p> It is no secret that climate change is having a devastating impact on humanity, ecosystems, and economies all over the world. In Canada, although there are several ecozones with different weather conditions, we are already seeing the effects of climate change in the form of record high temperatures, forest fires, flooding and the loss of ice and snow. To prevent further damage, the built environment has a significant part to play in reducing its carbon footprint. Within the built environment, changes in energy production in Canada can prevent further rising temperatures on our planet, and electrical engineers are at the forefront of transforming traditional methods using innovative, technological solutions. In this blog, we assess how electrical engineers can help to address climate change. </p>
							
							<p> An electrical engineerâ€™s role is aligned with the principles of carbon reduction because it involves establishing more efficient and affordable technology, providing a stable green energy network, and helping society to live better, smarter and more sustainably. With regard to climate change, electrical engineers aim to provide technical solutions by researching and developing renewable energy sources, energy storage systems and clean technology. Electrical engineers, therefore, have a responsibility to introduce new technologies and innovations to the energy industry so that society goes about its lives sustainably. </p>
